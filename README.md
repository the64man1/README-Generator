## Description
    
I was motivated to find a fast, simple method for generating high-quality README files for my GitHub projects


I wanted to write a program that would allow users to use the command line interface to enter information for each README section as plain text, and also choose a license for their project. The program would then have the markdown for their README generated and properly formatted, with a button for the license placed under the project title, and links to each section in a table of contents.


This program solves the problem of having to build a new README for each project that uses properly formatted markdown and manipulation of the file for including links for the table of contents and license badge.


In completing this project, I learned how to use the inquirer package for generating prompts and handling user input, the fs package for generating and writing data to files, how to format and implement links in markdown files, and how to write high-quality README files for GitHub projects.
